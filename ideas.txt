Shoot For the Moon

    Get to the moon? Steal it? Do something to the moon...

    Eldritch horror game? - Heavily pixelated 3d (lethal company shaders) <<<
        Iron Lung (markiplier) 3d spaceship - go to moon, then 2nd level land on moon
        Dark side of the moon has some lovecraftian horror, the player has to save the world by dying and blowing it up

        crisis management - things come up and you need to keep the ship functioning until it gets to the moon
        if you fail to maintain systems, you lose the system and get a debuff

        scripted event 1 - an eldritch horror "asteroid" collides with the oxygen system. you need to get the suit on
    
        a scripted event at the end where all systems break except the helm, and you reach the moon



        or maybe the players just a terrorist
        
    Dark souls FPS?


    Shooting "for" the moon
        a turret sitting on the moon - aliens are landing on it and you must save the game
        brutalist style - warhammer40k space marine/doom

        or "Lovers in a Dangerous" you control a moon thats in love with another moon. shoot asteroids and obstacles to help it win. Moonsex ❤️
